# Grade-Calculator
This code calculates your grade for a course, but it also calculates what you'd need to get on the final to achieve a certain mark. 
KEEP IN MIND THAT MOST COURSES REQUIRE YOU TO PASS A FINAL WITH 50%

In the future I will implement a website with this code, since Java code alone is not as easily acessible as I would like.

Messages and what they mean:
'Your grade can only go up'-this means that you already have this mark before taking the final. Regardless of what you get on the final, you will have at least this mark.
Taking the final will only raise your mark.
